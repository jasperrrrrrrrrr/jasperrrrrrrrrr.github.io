          <h3><b>Mission Statement</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="myp">
          <p>IMS, International Medical Services, delivers supplies such as water, food, and medication to areas in need of necessities. At IMS, we believe that everyone deserves their basic needs and we're taking action to make that dream a reality for all.         </p>

          <h3><b>Organization Structure</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="myp"></div>
          <p>Our company hopes to make the world a better place by doing our part in ending the starvation, disease, and dehydration epidemic in third world countries, or other places in the world that do not have as much money as other countries do. We will achieve this by employing a few hundred workers to oversee and repair drones that send medications and food to third-world countries. Mainly, the workers will have lots of autonomy and work by themselves.</p>

          <h3><b>Marketing</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="myp">
          <p>IMS uses outreach programs to spread its message to the community, such as fundraisers and food drives. IMS will have partnerships and sponsorships that will advertise us, as well as government funding. We will also cold call companies to get funds and support. IMS uses online advertisements like Instagram, other social media platforms, Youtube, Twitch, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook (Meta), TikTok, and LinkedIn to spread awareness of this program. We will advertise for a month so that we can gather supporters and investors for supplies and money.</p>

          <h3><b>Financial Statement and Investments</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "myp">
            <p>IMS is a non-profit organization funded by the U.S. and other government taxes, as well as private funding such as donations and sponsorship. Our companies' total first time payments will be 103.5 million. This consists of 100 mil for 10,000 drones, 1.5 mil for shipments delivered by the drones, and 2 mil for 100 stations (50 in Africa, 15 in South America, 20 in the Middle East, and 15 in the Malay Archipelago & India). From here on, IMS will use around $658,700,000 million per year, including yearly damage costs of drones (1.5 mil including 1,000,000 for damage and 500,000 for replacement) and monthly payments: $62,100,000 for 12 months ($658,700,000 per year) consisting of 1 mil on vaccine administration devices, 3 mil for Safeway food costs, 30 mil for Kaiser Permanente Medicine costs, 100,000 for advertisements, 20 mil for shipment boxes, and 8 mil for technicians and workers at stations.</p>

          <h3><b>Risk Analysis</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="myp">
          <p>Storms and other natural disasters are a possibility that we have taken into account. We know that we cannot delay aid to the sick and so we have created drones that are resistant to weather. With strong motors and propellers, our drones can drive off strong winds to get to their destination. Fomites, viruses that can be spread through objects, are another risk that we have taken into account. To ensure that these communities donâ€™t get sick without outside viruses (like when the British and Spanish sailors spread viruses to the Native Americans) each drone is sanitized before liftoff and after coming back. In addition, water, food, and medicine are prepared in airtight containers and no human contact occurs so that no viruses can get in. Our drones run on solar power with a small battery inside in case they need to run at night so there is no risk of our drones not being able to run during a black-out or electricity outage. Each drone is checked every month for any issues in being able to run or damage just in case.</p>
